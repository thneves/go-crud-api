# go-crud-api

## Simple CRUD example using GO.

### There is two structs representing a Movie and a Director

### Transform structs into JSON and use CRUD commands

### Clone the project and run

- `go build`
- `go run main.go` to open the server

### You can test the api using Postman, Insomnia, etc

Feel free to mess up with it to see how things work ;)
